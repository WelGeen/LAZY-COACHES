# LAZY-COACHES
In this investigation of digital coaches, we utilize the term "lazy" as a metaphor for ChatGPT. In the new world where AI is your buddy, it remains an object without a body, without a soul. This thing is unaware of its existence, but we are examining how this 'lazy' coach can assist in answering questions within the context of this ICT learning environment. The aim of this research is to analyze interactions and understand their impact on user motivation, with a focus on enhancing this innovation, the virtual assistant.
